# GBM Simulation and Numerical Analysis
This project is studies Geometric Brownian Motion(GBM) as a benchmark stochastic process and analyzes numerical solutions of stochastic differential equations.

The analysis was performed by  using Python in Google Colab.

## Overview
- Simulated the exact solution of GBM
- Implemented the Euler-Maruyama Numerical scheme
- verified strong and weak convergence rates empirically
- Analyzed terminal outome ditributions using statistical measures


## Tools
- Python
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
